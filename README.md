# # PetFace Emotion Recognition with ResNet-50

Welcome to PetFace, a project where we use the ResNet-50 model to recognize emotions in pet images. Our model is trained on a dataset consisting of approximately 1,000,000 face images of various pets, including dogs, cats, rabbits, hamsters, sheep, horses, and birds. These images capture the diverse range of expressions these animals can display, such as happiness, sadness, anger, and Other.

## About the Project

Our goal is to build a deep learning model capable of accurately predicting the emotions displayed by pets in images. We leverage the power of the ResNet-50 architecture, a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN), to achieve this task.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training our model is sourced from Kaggle and consists of a large collection of pet images. Each image is labeled with the corresponding emotion displayed by the pet, allowing our model to learn and generalize from the data.


## Model Evaluation

We assess our model's performance primarily through accuracy evaluation, where we have achieved an  accuracy rate of 98%. This indicates the model's robust capability in accurately predicting emotions across a diverse set of pet images, as validated on a separate validation dataset

## Future Work

In our future endeavors, we aspire to enhance the PetFace model by integrating a broader spectrum of emotions derived from real-life and internet pet images. This expansion aims to enrich the model's understanding of diverse emotional expressions, thus enabling more accurate predictions on a wider range of images. By incorporating a comprehensive dataset encompassing various emotions, we seek to improve the model's efficacy in accurately discerning and predicting emotions in pet images across real-world scenarios
